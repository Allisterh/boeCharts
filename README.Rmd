## Data Classification
Bank of England Data Classification: OFFICIAL BLUE

## Overview

`boeCharts` is an R package to help you create charts that are in-line with [the Bank's chart design guidelines](https://bankofengland.frontify.com/d/KN5KRtH8qzXF/design-guidelines#/brand-applications/chart-design-for-staff), recommended (and designed) for use in conjunction with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). 

It also contains design patterns for approximating charts found within flagship publications, including:

- [Bank Overground](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground)
- [Monetary Policy Report](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2019/november-2019) (FKA Inflation Report)
- [Financial Stability Report](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2019/july-2019)
- [Statistical Releases](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/money-and-credit/2019/april-2019)

N.B. this is still a maturing project. Feedback/issues/contributions appreciated. If you are reporting a bug/error and/or requesting a new feature, please try and use [the boeCharts backlog](https://almplatform/tfs/UnmanagedCollection/Shared%20Analytical%20Code/_backlogs/backlog/boeCharts/Requirements). For questions and other discussion, please use the [Data Community](https://bankexchange/groups/1067/SitePages/Home.aspx).

## Installation

`boeCharts` is not likely to be submitted to CRAN. Get the latest development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('bank-of-england/boeCharts', ref = "public")
```

## Usage

### Complementing a ggplot2 worflow

`boeCharts` provides native support for use with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (a popular R graphics library). You can use `scale_[colour|fill]_[continuous|discrete]_boe` functions for adopting Bank colour palettes within charts generated by `ggplot2`, and `theme_xxx` functions for applying full chart styles supported by `boeCharts`.

#### A minimal example

First, load packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(boeCharts)
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins) # for example purposes only
library(scales) # for date examples
```

Here is an out-of-the-box `ggplot2` chart.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

Custom themes can be applied to ggplot objects as additional "layers". As mentioned above, all `boeCharts` theme functions are prefixed by `theme_` e.g. `theme_overground()` applies the [Bank Overground](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground) chart theme:

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  # add Bank Overground theme
  theme_overground()
```

Custom ggplot scales help with applying Bank colour palettes. In this case, the points can be coloured with a "vibrant" Bank colour combination variant, via `scale_colour_discrete_boe()`, again as an additional ggplot layer:
 
```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_overground() +
  # add a "vibrant" Bank colour combination
  scale_colour_discrete_boe(palette = "vibrant_c")
```
 
Now, switching in the [Bank's chart design guidelines](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2019/november-2019) theme and colours. Additionally, `scale_y_continuous()` is used to move the y-axis across to the right.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  # add visual identity theme
  theme_boe_identity() +
  # add a "vibrant" Bank colour combination
  scale_colour_discrete_boe(palette = "boe_identity") +
  # move the y-axis to the right
  scale_y_continuous(
    position = "right", sec.axis = dup_axis(labels = NULL)
    ) +
  theme(axis.title.y.left = element_blank())
```

#### An in-depth example

Another `ggplot2` + `boeCharts` creation, this time investigating some more customization options, including:

- automatic axis breaks/limits (using `boe_breaks|limits_date|numeric()`)
- direct line labels (using `position_voronoi()`)
- strong horizontal line at zero

```{r, example}
# create chart
chart <- ggplot(data = FANG, aes(x = date, y = close, colour = symbol)) +
  # add lines + hide legend
  geom_line(lwd = 0.75, lineend = "round", show.legend = FALSE) +
  # add series labels + hide legend
  geom_text(
    aes(label = symbol), position = position_voronoi(), 
    family = "Calibri", show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
  # add some chart labels
  labs(
    title = "Chart 1.2: Historical FANG stock prices",
    subtitle = "Stock price at the close of trading (USD), 2013-2016",
    caption = caption_boe(source = "Investopedia"),
    x = NULL, y = NULL
    ) +
  # use 'highlights' palette
  scale_colour_discrete_boe(palette = "boe_identity") +
  # add Bank Overground theme
  theme_boe_identity() +
  # apply custom axis settings
  scale_y_continuous(
    expand = c(0, 0), breaks = boe_breaks_numeric(), 
    limits = boe_limits_numeric(), position = "right"
    ) +
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::label_date_short(),
    breaks = boe_breaks_date(), limits = boe_limits_date()
    ) +
  add_hline0() # strong line at zero

chart
```

#### Markdown theme variants

A Markdown variant of each {boeCharts} theme has been made with a `md_` suffix, like `theme_mpr_md()`. These themes add support for rendering text as markdown, thanks to the [ggtext](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/index.html) package. Here's an example:

```{r}
chart +
  theme_boe_identity_md() +
  labs(
    title = "**Chart A.2** Historical FANG stock prices",
    subtitle = "Stock price at the close of trading (USD), 2013-2016",
    caption = caption_boe(source = "Investopedia")
    )
```

### Using custom fonts

`boeCharts` helps you safely import and use fonts other than the basic fonts R already uses (with help from the `extrafont` package). These fonts can be imported using an associated `import_` utility function. For example, to import Calibri (used by default in some `boeCharts` themes), you should run the `import_calibri()` function. If you want to use fonts in PDF (or Postscript) output files, set the `boeCharts.loadfonts` option to `TRUE`.

N.B. the font import step only needs to be run once on your machine. Fonts will be loaded automatically when you load `boeCharts` in future R sessions.
