boeCharts
=========

Overview
--------

The `boeCharts` R package contains Bank chart styles and themes, for use in conjunction with [ggplot2](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2). It currently houses designs for approximating charts found within:

-   [Bank Overground](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground)
-   [Bank website - statistics](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/visual-summaries/effective-interest-rates)
-   [Inflation Report](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/inflation-report/2018/august-2018/global-economic-and-financial-market-developments)
-   [Statistical Releases](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/statistics/money-and-credit/2018/february-2018.pdf?la=en&hash=D5A6531045C648B4169D5FD480723AE4CFBD75F9)

Install
-------

**boeCharts** is an R package/library best used via R Studio (installed from the [software catalogue](http://sccm-wl-mgt-01/CMApplicationCatalog)).

Get the latest stable version of **boeCharts** by running the below code within an R session:

``` r
# install remotes package (required for local package installs)
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

# install boeCharts
install.packages("http://collaborate/workspaces/RHelpCentre/R%20documents/Packages/boeCharts_1.0.0.zip", repos = NULL, type = "binary")

# install any missing dependencies from CRAN
remotes::install_deps(find.package("boeCharts"))
```

Use
---

`boeCharts` provides native support for use with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (a popular R graphics library). You can use `scale_[colour|fill]_boe` functions for adopting Bank colour palettes within charts generated by `ggplot2`, and `theme_xxx` functions for applying full chart styles supported by `boeCharts`.

``` r
# load packages
library(boeCharts)
library(ggplot2)

# create chart
ggplot(data = FANG, aes(x = date, y = close, colour = symbol)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "BoE Palette Test",
       subtitle = "A plot for demonstration purposes",
       y = "Closing\nprice", x = NULL) +
  # apply boe colour palette
  scale_colour_boe() +
  # apply an MCG publication theme
  theme_mcg_pub(axis_text_size = 11) +
  # apply custom axis settings
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 1250, 250), 
                     limits = c(0, 1250), position = "right") +
  scale_x_date(expand = c(0, 0), labels = boe_date_labels(),
               breaks = seq(min(FANG$date), max(FANG$date), by = "3 months"))
```

Contribute
----------

This is an ongoing project to abstract and consolidate Bank charting guidelines, and any/all contributions are encouraged. Inspecting the source code in this repository will help with understanding how to make a custom palette, or building a chart theme for your business area. The following resources are also helpful (and inspired much of this effort):

-   [Modify components of a theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)
-   [govstyle](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govstyle)
-   [hrbrthemes](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes)
-   [Building a new theme](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/building-a-new-theme.html)

Also, for general consideration when contributing to the package, try to:

-   Observe principles in Hadley Wickham's [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/)
-   Follow the Git branch (see [here](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/13/rstudio-v1.1-the-little-things/) for how to create a branch from within R Studio) & [pull request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/pullrequest?view=azure-devops) model, or [contact Ewen](mailto:ewen.henderson@bankofengland.co.uk)
